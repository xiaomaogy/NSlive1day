# NS Eat & Play Guide

Recently, while staying at Network School in Forest City, we’ve often visited nearby small towns. After many trips, I’ve gathered some useful tips and experiences to share.

## Towns Overview:

Arranged in order of distance from Forest City, here are several nearby towns worth visiting:

### 1. Eco Botanic (Iskandar Puteri)

This is the closest town to us, about a 20-minute ride by car and costs around 20 RM. The town has plenty of good food (e.g., Wang Nai Nai Handmade Noodles), various types of massages (e.g., Siam Oriental Zen Thai Massage at Eco Botanic), some nice cafés (e.g., Tom&Danny Coffee @ Eco Botanic), and a large supermarket (Jaya Grocer Eco Galleria) with very fresh fruits (papaya, strawberries, grapes, mangoes, blueberries, jackfruit, etc.). In the same mall, there are also many beauty salons, escape rooms, and game arcades. The only downside is that there are no durian stalls.

### 2. Gelang Patah

This is the second-closest town, technically also part of Iskandar Puteri, but you can’t walk there from Eco Botanic—you still need to take a car.

This town is more rundown, but it has two things you won’t find in Eco Botanic. One is a few durian stalls, such as JB Durian ChengXin Fruit Trading. I’ve tried this stall twice, but the durians weren’t particularly good. There are also a few other durian vendors I haven’t tried yet.

There’s also a small shop here that sells roasted buns (shao bao), which I happened to try once and found incredibly delicious—highly recommended.

### 3. Bukit Indah

Bukit Indah is more commercially developed and has even more great food.

Top recommendation goes to two Bak Kut Teh restaurants:

- **E Pin Restaurant**: Their dry-style Bak Kut Teh is amazing, tasting like braised pork in a clay pot. It’s especially good with mushrooms and is very affordable. Downside: no air conditioning.
- **Restaurant Shun Fa Bak Kut Teh**: A very old and well-established place. I personally like their sesame oil chicken, which is similar to braised chicken pot but with a different twist. The ginger chicken is also tasty.

There are a few massage parlors in this square, but I haven’t tried any yet.

Nearby is a nice mall (ÆON Mall Bukit Indah) where you can buy various fitness supplements and branded clothing. The ground floor has a large grocery store that’s even better in quality than Jaya Grocer mentioned above, offering a wide variety of fresh fruits. Their pre-cut papaya and jackfruit are especially fresh and sweet. I also found durian mochi here (not recommended to buy a whole box—it’s too much).

### 4. Nusa Bestari

This commercial square is right next to Bukit Indah, about a 10-minute walk away, though walking isn’t very convenient. It’s a bit older than the Bukit Indah square and has a grocery store, but with fewer choices—not recommended.

However, this square has the largest durian street I’ve seen so far, with 5-7 durian vendors grouped together (around Uncle Han Durian). The durians here are pretty good. Based on my personal experience, don’t let them open the durian for you—instead, go for the pre-packaged ones in plastic boxes. They tend to taste better. This may be because vendors often give foreigners lower-quality durians when opening them fresh. Pre-packaged boxes don’t give them much choice, so the quality is generally better.

Typical prices: labeled as RM28 per box, you can usually bargain down to RM20. If buying more, you may get it for RM15.

Here’s a brief intro to the durian varieties I’ve tried so far:

#### 1. Musang King

The most common and usually most expensive variety. Comes in RM28, RM38, and RM48 boxes. RM48 usually comes from old trees—more bitter, but rich in aftertaste. RM38 is sweeter but less complex. RM28 is more bitter but lacks depth. Usual bargain range: RM15–20, RM25–30, RM30–35 per box.

#### 2. Red Prawn

Mostly sweet but with a slight bitterness. Priced around RM28 or RM38, depending on quality. I visited in May, which seems to be Red Prawn season. Good ones are very sweet, even rich. If yours isn’t sweet enough, it’s likely not a good one.

#### 3. Black Pearl

Extremely sweet, somewhat like Thailand’s Monthong durians. Not very suitable for heavy eating, but if you're just having one box and don’t like bitter flavors, this one is probably the best.

#### 4. Black Thorn

Similar to Black Pearl, but slightly less sweet—its sweetness is cleaner and more refreshing. Easier to eat in quantity. Possibly not in season in May, as fewer vendors offered it.

#### 5. Green Thorn

Said to be the “younger brother” of Black Thorn. I haven’t tried it, but I assume it’s similar.

#### 6. Creamy Bun (Nai You Bao)

Mildly sweet with a creamy flavor, not bitter.

These are the ones I’ve encountered so far. Feel free to add more varieties!

Also, the Healthland massage place in Nusa Bestari is quite good.

### 5. Taman Sutera Utama

This area has a particularly tasty **lala pot (shellfish hot pot)** called **5PM Lalapot**. It might be the most famous and popular spot in all of Johor. Last time we went, it was already packed the moment they opened. Highly recommend the kampong chicken combo—great pairing with the seafood. The marshmallow and biscuit dessert afterward is also amazing.

Next door is a dessert shop called **Four Beans Soy Desserts Sutera Utama**, which has very fresh and rich-flavored tofu pudding.

I’ve only been to this plaza once. I also tried a Thai massage nearby, but it was just average—not worth recommending.

That’s all for now. I’ll keep updating this guide over time.
